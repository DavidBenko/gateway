<h2>Making apps that work with Camlistore</h2>

<p>Camlistore is built so that other apps can securely access and store data without running alongside it. Camlistore is the perfect backing store for other web apps and CMSes.</p>

<p>Detailed documention on the HTTP blob retrieval protocol can be found at <a href="/docs/protocol">the protocol documentation</a>. The <a href="/pkg/client">client</a>, <a href="/pkg/search">search</a> and <a href="/pkg/schema">schema</a> packages are also a good place to start.</p>
