<h1>Release 0.4 ("Oyens")</h1>

<p><b>2013-08-26</b></p>

<p>About a month after the <a href="0.3">0.3 release (Glebe)</a>,
we're happy to release 0.4, codename "Oyens".  <a
href="https://maps.google.com/?q=Oyens,+IA">Oyens, Iowa</a> is one of the cutest
towns you've never seen and where I did a lot of work on this release.
Its population of 102 includes my grandparents, who let me "work" on
Camlistore (yes, Grandma, even after 5pm) when they're not busy
force-feeding me.</p>

<h1>New in 0.4</h1>

<p>There were 8 contributors to this release (3 of whom are new). Here's what we've been up to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No external dependencies! Camlistore can still use any indexer that it could before (SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Mongo, App Engine, etc) but it now also comes with <a href="https://github.com/cznic/kv">cznic/kv</a> built-in.  If SQLite is available, that is the default for new installs, otherwise cznic/kv is used.  This makes things much easier for new Windows users, for instance.  (Thanks to Jan Mercl for cznic/kv!)</li>
  <li>UI work (thanks Aaron Boodman!)<br/>Click for more screenshots:<br/><a href="http://imgur.com/XN9qFLP,PeEDPnW,CS35Pw6,VS0nHaG,SNT1ZXZ,2nMWVYz,8RmuLuw,NE8b26n,EFErMdg"><img src="/static/ss/8RmuLuw.jpg" width=650 height=370></a></li>
  <li>Start of Google Drive backend (thanks Burcu Dogan!)</li>
  <li>Add <code>camtool dumpconfig</code> sub-command</li>
  <li>The <code>dev-server</code> and <code>dev-appengine</code> scripts are gone. Use the new portable <code>devcam</code> tool instead. Build with "go get camlistore.org/dev/devcam"</li>
  <li>FreeBSD bug fixes (thanks Bill Thiede!)</li>
  <li>Windows bug fixes</li>
  <li>Fix Android client (previously partially broken in 0.3)</li>
  <li>dust off and fix up App Engine support</li>
  <li>Code cleanups, bug fixes, optimizations, and internal interface simplifications</li>
  <li>Rewrite of base blobref type for reduced memory usage and ease of coding</li>
</ul>
