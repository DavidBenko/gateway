<h1>Release 0.2 ("Portland")</h1>

<p><b>2013-06-22</b></p>

<p>Hot on the heels of our first release (<a href="0.1">Grenoble</a>),
we're happy to be getting better at this release thing and announce
0.2, codename "Portland".  Portland is my hometown and currently
hosting <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/">IndieWebCamp</a>.</p>

<h1>What is Camlistore?</h1>

<p>See the <a href="/docs/">docs</a> and <a href="/docs/overview">overview</a>.</p>

<h1>What works?</h1>

<p>Everything that <a href="0.1">worked in 0.1</a>.</p>

<h1>New in 0.2</h1>

<ul>
  <li><b>Encryption support.</b> It hasn't been audited yet, metadata compaction isn't quite done, and the simple-config-to-low-level-config translator isn't enabled yet, so consider it all beta. It's there to use if you know what you're doing, but the underlying format might yet change.</li>
  <li><b>Improved build system.</b> Our build by default now embeds all the <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/library/">Closure</a> resources into the server binary, making deployment much easier: just one file (the server binary) to put on your server.</li>
  <li><b>Easier initial setup.</b> More helpful initial configuration of <a href="/cmd/camput"><code>camput</code></a>, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Config files moved.</b> We now respect the <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">XDG Base Directory Specification</a> on Unix systems. If you had your config files in <code>~/.camlistore/</code> before, move them to <code>~/.config/camlistore/</code>.</li>
  <li><b>Fixes</b>: <ul>
      <li>The SQLite backend now uses <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/draft/wal.html">WAL</a> when available, for improved throughput with high concurrency. A bug in our build system's detection of SQLite was also fixed.</li>
      <li>The sharing handler was partially broken in 0.1, now fixed.</li>
   </ul></li>
</ul>
