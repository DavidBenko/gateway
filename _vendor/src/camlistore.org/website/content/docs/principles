# Principles

**TODO:** elaborate.  This is just a quick sketch.

* Disk is cheap and getting cheaper. No need to delete in general.

* Put the user in control.  Own your data.

* Privacy and paranoia

* Decentralization is important, but..

* End users won't be dorks.  Must also be possible to be easy, hosted.

* Content-Addressability has so many great properties (validation,
  cachability, etc).  Use it as much as possible.

* Redundancy and over-explicitness is fine.  Compression will
  help.  Redundancy and over-explicitness will be convenient for
  future digital archeologists, too.
