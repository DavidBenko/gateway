<h1>Schema</h1>

<p>
  At the lowest layer, Camlistore doesn't care what you put in it
  (everything is just dumb bytes) and you're free to adopt your own
  data model.  However, the upper layers of Camlistore standardize on
  a <a href="/gw/doc/schema">common schema</a> to represent various
  classes of data.
</p>

<p>
  Schema blobs are JSON objects with at least two attributes always
  set: <code>camliVersion</code>, which is always 1,
  and <code>camliType</code>, which tells you the type of metadata the
  blob contains.
</p>

<p>
  Here are some of the data types we've started to formalize
  a <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> schema for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://camlistore.org/gw/doc/schema/files">Files</a>:
    traditional filesystems.  Files, directories, inodes, symlinks,
    etc. Uses the <code>file</code>, <code>directory</code>, <code>symlink</code>,
    and <code>inode</code> camliTypes.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="schema/permanode">Permanodes</a>: the immutable root
    "anchor" of mutable Camlistore objects
    (see <a href="terms">terminology</a>). Users create
    signed <a href="/docs/schema/permanode#claim">claim</a> schema
    blobs which reference a permanode and define some mutation for the
    permanode.
    <br>
    Permanodes are used to model many kinds of mutable data, including
    mutable files, dynamic directories, and more.
    <br>
    Uses the <code>permanode</code> and <code>claim</code> camliTypes.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="/gw/doc/schema/objects/static-set.txt">Static Sets</a>:
    Immutable lists of other blobs by their refs. Indicated by
    the <code>static-set</code> camliType.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="/gw/doc/schema/objects/keep.txt">"Keep" claims</a>:
    Normally, any object that isn't referenced by a permanode could
    theoretically be garbage collected. Keep claims prevent that from
    happening. Indicated by the <code>keep</code> camliType.
  </li>
</ul>
