This file's random string on the first line is an optimization and
paranoia facility for clients.

If the client sees the same random string in multiple upload sessions,
it assumes that the blobserver still has all the same blobs, and also
it's the same server.  This mechanism is not fundamental to
Camlistore's operation: the client could also check each blob before
uploading, or enumerate all blobs from the server too.  This is purely
an optimization so clients can mix this value into their "is this file
uploaded?" local cache keys.

If you deleted any blobs (or suspect any were corrupted), it's best to
delete this file so clients can safely re-upload them.
