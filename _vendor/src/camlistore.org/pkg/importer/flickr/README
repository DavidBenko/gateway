Flickr Importer
===============

This is an incomplete Camlistore importer for Flickr. So far it can import the
first 100 photos from a photostream and also their set metadata.

To use:

1) Fill out http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/noncommercial/ to get a
   Flickr API key and secret.
2) Start the devcam server with flickrapikey flag:
   $ devcam server -flickrapikey=<apikey>:<secret>
3) Navigate to http://<server>/importer-flickr/login
4) Watch import progress on the command line
