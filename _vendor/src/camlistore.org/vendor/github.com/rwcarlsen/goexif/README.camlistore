Syncing updates from upstream goexif
====================================

We do not ship the "samples" directory, nor the "corrupt" one, which contain data for the
tests. For this reason, we do not include the _test.go files either, as well as
regen_regress.go (which is used to generate some of the data for the tests).

It is your duty, when updating our goexif third party from upstream, to check that all the
tests in the upstream repo pass.
