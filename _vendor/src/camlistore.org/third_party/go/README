This directory contains code from the Go standard library either
imported from tip (to take advantage of new features and bug fixes
before they're available in the stable branch), or modified in ways
that Camlistore needs.

A summary:

* pkg/image/jpeg: performance improvements going into Go 1.4
  such as https://codereview.appspot.com/109050045/

* pkg/archive/zip: copy of Go 1.4's archive/zip, for Writer.Flush,
  needed by blobpacked
