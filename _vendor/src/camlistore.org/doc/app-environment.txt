Camlistore applications run with the following environment variables set:

CAMLI_API_HOST (string):
  URL prefix of the Camlistore server which the app should use to make API calls.
  It always ends in a trailing slash. Examples:
    https://foo.org:3178/pub/
    https://foo.org/pub/
    http://192.168.0.1/
    http://192.168.0.1:1234/

CAMLI_APP_BACKEND_URL (string):
  URL of the application's process, always ending in a trailing slash. That path
  represents the top-most path that requests will hit. The path usually matches
  the path as visible in the outside world when camlistored is proxying an app,
  but that is not guaranteed. Examples:
    https://foo.org:3178/pub/
    https://foo.org/pub/
    http://192.168.0.1/
    http://192.168.0.1:1234/

CAMLI_APP_CONFIG_URL (string):
  URL containing JSON configuration for the app. The app should once, upon
  startup, fetch this URL (using CAMLI_AUTH) to retrieve its configuration data.
  The response JSON is the contents of the app's "appConfig" part of the config
  file.

CAMLI_AUTH (string):
  Username and password (username:password) that the app should use to
  authenticate over HTTP basic auth with the Camlistore server. Basic auth is
  unencrypted, hence it should only be used with HTTPS or in a secure (local
  loopback) environment.
