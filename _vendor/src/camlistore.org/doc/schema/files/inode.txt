Inode schema.

{"camliVersion": 1,
 "camliType": "inode",
 "inodeId": 12345  // st_ino
 "deviceId": 53,   // st_dev
 "numLinks": 3,    // st_nlink
}

This is optional and probably rarely used, but lets two+ files be
represented as hardlinks with each other.  If both files point to the
same inode object, they're hardlinks of each other.

Note that unlink "directory", "file", and "schema", this does not
inherit fields from the "file-common" schema.
